# react-responsive-utils
React components for showing or hiding children components, based on media queries.

Based and inspired on what's suggested by the `<HideAt>` and `<ShowAt>` components shown in [this block of code from this AirBnb's engineering blog post](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/rearchitecting-airbnbs-frontend-5e213efc24d2#d5f9).

## Utility Components:

Initial version is here, for now: https://gist.github.com/berbaquero/3a21f7a7e5e9b08474d9a83130f86ab9
